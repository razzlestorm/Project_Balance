"Stay informed, but stay sane"

News app uses sentiment analysis to ensure that people don't read too much negative news without reading positive news.
Uses topic modeling to divide into major categories, and then further into subcategories

No navigation, just browsing
adjust weights for suggestions between postive/negative based on how much negative news has been tapped

Long-term:
    Tag news for users, see what sort of help they might need, then provide 3rd party contacts
    E.g. searching for coronavirus, pop up with CDC notes and nearest hospital contact info

All experience is based on their reactions

When signing up:
    Pick what they are interested in, then after onboarding, they go to home feed and see what they like, sorted by date
